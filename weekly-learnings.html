            In the first week, we participated in several activities designed to test the theory of left and right brain dominance. These exercises were not only fun but also served an important purpose—they helped us feel more comfortable in the classroom environment while encouraging us to engage our left brain. Instead of simply following set rules or creative instincts, we were challenged to think critically, analyze situations, and solve problems logically. The goal was to develop a habit of approaching tasks with a balanced mindset, combining creativity with structure. These activities laid the foundation for how we’ll think and learn throughout the course.

            In the second week, we were introduced to the profiling sheet, which contained a series of important questions commonly asked in interviews. These questions were thoughtfully designed to help us reflect on our career goals, strengths, and readiness for the professional world. From a placement perspective, this activity was extremely valuable, as it encouraged us to start preparing early for real-world interview scenarios. We were guided to thoughtfully answer each question and then record video responses, which would later be added to our e-portfolio. This exercise not only helped us gain confidence in presenting ourselves but also allowed us to showcase our communication skills in a structured and professional manner.

            This week, we were told to prepare groups of maximum 7 members and then we had to give our presentations about a product or idea based on our creativity based on business perspective. We learnt many things like how to give presentations and how to present data etc. the topic of our group was a video game named Echo and the name of our company was Temporal Rift Games.

            In Week 4, we focused on Group Discussions. Groups wer made according to our roll no. and we were given topics accordingly. The topic that was given in my group was "WHat is more important for a B.Tech Student, sitting in placement drives or opening his/her startups. Other than this we wre told the fundamentals of GD , why is itn conduxted how it is conducted and further we got to know about idea generation techniques. "
