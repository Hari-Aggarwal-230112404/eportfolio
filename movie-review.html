        <p><strong>Review:</strong>  
        <em>The persuit of happiness</em> The persuit of happiness is more than just a film—it's a moving portrayal of hope, perseverance, and resilience. Based on the true story, the movie tells the story of Chris Gardener, a salesman who lives in Sans Francisco.
Through his tough times he still believes in himself that he wanted to give his son a better life.Chris becomes a symbol of quiet resilience and integrity. 
What makes this movie stand out is its ability to capture the emotional and psychological transformation of its characters. It doesn't rely on action or spectacle—instead, it digs deep into human nature, the faterhood nature, and the undying power of our main character .This movie was a roller coaster ride of emotions.</p>

        <p><strong>Favourite Dialogue:</strong><br>
        <q>"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."</q></p>

        <p><strong>Learning:</strong><br>
        The biggest lesson I learned from this movie is to **never lose hope**, even when life seems stuck or unfair. Chris's quiet determination and faith that better days will come reminds me to stay patient and trust the process—even in the darkest of times.</p>
