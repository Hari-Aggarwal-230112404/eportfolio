        <p>As a second-year B.Tech student, my career objective is to build a strong foundation in my field of engineering and gain hands-on experience through internships and real-world projects. I aim to continuously improve my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork, so I can contribute meaningfully to innovative and impactful projects. In the long run, I aspire to work in a dynamic environment where I can apply my knowledge to develop solutions that address real-world challenges, while also growing professionally into a leadership or specialized technical role.</p>

        <p>As of now I'm not interested in animation and designing field, I firstly want to excel in my field, which is programming and problem solving. Thats why I am not curious about it. But I don't know what the future holds.</p>

        <p>I have not done anything significant inthe recent past, but one thing I have done is that I consider as an achievement is achieving good result in class 12. The major happiness was not about me getting good grades but the fact that my parents were really happy about my this particular achievement made that moment a memorable one.</p>

        <p>I don't consider mistakes as failure, I've done some horrible mistakes in the last couple of years that is I've been way to comfortable and not doing anything to get out of my comfort zone. But the good part is that I'm trying to overcome this failure.</p>

        <p>I believe that I possess some leadership qualities.If i have to share one instance with you all ,is that,During a recent group assignment in one of my courses, we were tasked with creating a presentation on a complex topic. A few days before the presentation, one of my teammates faced personal issues and couldn’t contribute much to the work. I quickly stepped up to learn more about the topic to ensure the presentation would be complete. I collaborated with the remaining team members, effectively splitting the workload and communicating regularly to keep everyone on track. On the day of the presentation, we faced an unexpected technical issue with the projector. I immediately came up with a workaround by connecting our devices to an alternative system, allowing the presentation to continue smoothly. This experience allowed me to demonstrate my quick learning, problem-solving skills, and ability to work efficiently under pressure."</p>

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <div class="question">

        <p>One weakness I’ve identified is overthinking, especially with complex tasks. While it ensures thorough understanding, it can delay decision-making. To overcome this, I focus on taking action and making progress, even if the solution isn't perfect.
Lastly, time management under pressure has been a challenge. I’m addressing this by using task management tools to prioritize and break down tasks into smaller steps to meet deadlines more efficiently.</p>

        <p>One of the most difficult moments I faced was when I had a minor medical issue that affected my daily routine and concentration during my studies. It was a challenging time as I had to manage my health while keeping up with academic responsibilities. My patience, resilience, and time management skills helped me overcome this phase. I stayed disciplined with my treatment, adjusted my study schedule, and remained focused on my goals. This experience taught me the importance of balance, self-care, and staying strong during tough situations.</p>

        <p>I enjoy working with people who are cooperative, open-minded, and committed to their work. I value team members who communicate clearly, share ideas, and are willing to support each other to achieve common goals. I also appreciate working with those who are positive, adaptable to changes, and focused on finding solutions rather than problems. Being around such people motivates me and brings out my best teamwork and problem-solving abilities.</p>

        <p>I prefer not to work with people who are negative, uncooperative, or unwilling to listen to new ideas. Working with someone who doesn’t encourage teamwork or growth can make things challenging. However, if such a person were to become my senior in my dream job, I would still maintain professionalism. I would focus on learning whatever I can from them, keep communication clear, and adapt my approach to ensure the team’s goals are met. I believe that with patience and a positive attitude, even difficult situations can be managed effectively.</p>

        <p>In my first job, I can expect a lot of learning, both technically and professionally. I will likely face new challenges that will help me apply my knowledge in real-world situations. I can also expect to work under deadlines, adapt to different tasks, and improve my communication and teamwork skills. It will be a phase where I build my foundation, understand workplace culture, and learn from seniors and mentors. Overall, I see my first job as an opportunity for growth, skill development, and stepping confidently into the professional world.</p>

        <p>In the past year, I feel I could have managed my time more efficiently, especially during periods when multiple tasks and deadlines overlapped. At times, I focused too much on perfecting small details, which affected my overall speed and balance between tasks. Recognizing this, I have started working on improving my time management skills by setting clearer priorities and focusing on completing tasks effectively rather than aiming for perfection every time. This has helped me become more productive and balanced in my approach.</p>

        <p>I would rate myself 3 out of 5 in terms of verbal communication.I’m actively working on improving my communication skills through a variety of strategies.

I also focus on active listening, making sure I fully understand others before responding, as good communication starts with listening. To express myself better, I continuously try to expand my vocabulary by reading books, watching informative content, and learning new phrases</p>

        <p>Three important leadership qualities are:
Good communication – the ability to clearly express ideas and listen to others.
Responsibility – being accountable for decisions and actions.
Confidence – staying calm and decisive, especially in challenging situations.
I believe I possess at least two of these qualities: I communicate well with others, especially in group tasks, and I take responsibility seriously. I’m still working on building more confidence, especially when leading bigger groups, but I’m improving with practice.</p>
